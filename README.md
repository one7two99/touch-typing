## My current keyboard layout
This layout needs 8 layers in total and is based on the Miryoku layout.
You can find the VIAL configuration file in this repo. It can be imported into your VIAL application.
My Corne v4 keyboard is running with a modified firmware which supports 16 layers (Layer 0 to 15).

Base layer plus three right thumb key layers for Symbols, Numbers and Functions Keys
